# How to install a Modpack and join a Modded Server

For this, you need to have the name of the modpack and the IP address of the server you are joining.


1: Download the Curse Desktop App (@ https://curseforge.overwolf.com/) and run the installer.  
2: Run the Curse Desktop App and click the "Mods" tab at the top.  
3: Then click "Minecraft".  
3a: If a button labeled `install` appears, click that.  
4: Click the search bar at the top and type in the modpack name.  
5: Click the install button on the right side of the correct modpack.  
5a: (If it's a modpack I made, you know its right because it says `by frenzyboys3` next to the name)  
7: If everything worked, you should now see the modpack under the tab `My Modpacks`.  
8: Click the `Play` button and hit the big green button when the Minecraft Launcher opens.  
9: Once you see the title screen, click `Multiplayer`.  
10a: If the server you are looking for is already there, go to step 11.  
10b: If it isn't, click `Add Server`, and then type in `the server ip` in the lower of the two boxes.  You can type whatever you want in the top box.  Then click `Done` and proceed.  
11: Double-click the server as it appears in the multiplayer menu to join it.  
12: If something went wrong and you can't figure it out, open an issue and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
