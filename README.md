# How to install a Modpack and get on Vita Serva

1: Download the (insert pack name here).zip file from wherever you found it.                                                       
2: Download the Twitch Desktop app and run the installer.                                                                          
3: Run the Twitch Desktop app and click the "Mods" tab at the top.                                                                 
4: Then click "Minecraft" and from there, "Create Custom Profile".                                                                 
5: You should see a menu that looks just like the one in the provided screen capture.  Click the word "import" that I circled for you.

6: Navigate to the .zip file you downloaded, select it, and click "Open".                                                          
7: If everything worked, you should now see a modpack titled (insert pack name here) under the tab "My Modpacks".                                                 
8: Click the "Play" button and hit the big green button when the Minecraft Launcher Opens.                                         
9: Once you see the title screen, click "Multiplayer", then "Add Server", and then type in `vitaserva.mcph.co` in the lower of the two boxes.  You can type whatever you want in the top box.                                                                         
10: Next click "Done" and double-click the server as it appears in the multiplayer menu.                                           
11: If something went wrong and you can't figure it out, open an issue and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
