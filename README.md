8: Click the `Play` button and hit the big green button when the Minecraft Launcher opens.  
9: Once you see the title screen, click `Multiplayer`.  
10a: If the server you are looking there is already there, go to step 11.  
10b: If it isn't, click `Add Server`, and then type in `the server ip` in the lower of the two boxes.  You can type whatever you want in the top box.  Then click `Done` and proceed.  
11: Double-click the server as it appears in the multiplayer menu to join it.  
12: If something went wrong and you can't figure it out, open an issue and I'll get to it as soon as I can.
